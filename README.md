This app basically sends users Fake notifications to their iPhone.

Users can set:
- Frequency of messages (Once everuy 5-15 minutes)
- The gender of the "sender" 
- The sound of the notification (iMessage, tinder, snapchat, instagram)

The intention is to let users simulate being popular and having an active social life. Feel their phone erupt with people fighting for their attention

Useful for first dates, and useful for people that want to appear like they have a lot going on. (think,,, first day of school at a new school)


No more documentation, this is my biggest solo project outside of work.
